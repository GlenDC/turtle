# turtle

iOS and Android game to learn programming using the Turtle approach.

Inspired by Logo programming, that many of us grew up with,
and with the manual primitive tools our kids draw on paper with every day.

Goal is to have them visually program, with simple commands,
and let it be possible to record the drawing of it as an animation (e.g. `gif`)
or do so as a final image.

Designs can be shared as such recording/image,
or they can be shared with the code through the community server
(available to those who bought iOS/Android app only).
